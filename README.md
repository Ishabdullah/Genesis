## 🧮 Deterministic Math Engine

Genesis doesn't guess at math problems - it **solves them algebraically**.

### Example: Classic "Bat and Ball" Problem

**Traditional LLM Response:** ❌ "The ball costs $0.10" (WRONG)

**Genesis Response:** ✅ "$0.05" (CORRECT with proof)

```
Genesis> A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00
         more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?

[Thinking... 🧬 Local]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Step 1: Define variables
  Formula: Let smaller_item = x, larger_item = x + difference
  → ball = x, bat = x + 1.0
  = Variables defined

Step 2: Set up equation from total
  Formula: smaller + larger = total → x + (x + difference) = total
  → x + (x + 1.0) = 1.1
  = 2x + 1.0 = 1.1

Step 3: Solve for smaller item
  Formula: 2x = total - difference → x = (total - difference) / 2
  → 2x = 1.1 - 1.0 = 0.1 → x = 0.1 / 2
  = 0.05

Step 4: Calculate larger item
  Formula: larger = smaller + difference
  → 0.05 + 1.0
  = 1.05

Step 5: Verify the answer
  Formula: Check: smaller + larger = total AND larger - smaller = difference
  → 0.05 + 1.05 = 1.1, 1.05 - 0.05 = 1.0
  = ✓ Verified

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Final Answer: $0.05
Confidence: High (0.99)
```

### Supported Problem Types

- ✅ **Rate Problems**: machines/workers, units/time, proportional scaling
- ✅ **Difference Equations**: "A costs $X more than B"
- ✅ **Logical Interpretation**: "all but X", "remaining", conditional logic
- ✅ **Multi-step Puzzles**: Light switches, sequential logic, state tracking

## 🧠 Context-Aware Reasoning

Genesis adapts its reasoning strategy based on question type:

| Problem Type | Template Strategy | Example Steps |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Math/Logic** | Multi-step calculation | Understand → Variables → Equation → Solve → Verify |
| **Programming** | Algorithm design | Requirements → Pseudocode → Implementation → Test |
| **System Design** | Architecture planning | Requirements → Components → Interactions → Constraints |
| **Metacognitive** | Self-reflection | Understand → Identify → Explain → Provide |
| **General** | Flexible reasoning | Analyze → Reason → Conclude |

### Pseudocode Generation Example

```
Genesis> Write a function to find the longest common subsequence

[Thinking... 🧬 Local]
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Pseudocode:
  function LCS(string1, string2):
    create 2D table[len1+1][len2+1]
    initialize first row and column to 0

    for i from 1 to len1:
      for j from 1 to len2:
        if string1[i-1] == string2[j-1]:
          table[i][j] = table[i-1][j-1] + 1
        else:
          table[i][j] = max(table[i-1][j], table[i][j-1])

    return table[len1][len2]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[Python implementation follows...]
```

## 🎓 Feedback Learning System

Genesis learns from corrections with detailed notes:

### Providing Feedback

```bash
# Simple feedback
Genesis> #correct
Genesis> #incorrect

# Feedback with detailed notes
Genesis> #correct — excellent step-by-step explanation
Genesis> #incorrect — wrong calculation in step 3, should multiply not divide
```

### What Happens With Your Feedback

Your feedback with notes is stored in **3 locations**:

1. **Performance Metrics** (`data/genesis_metrics.json`)
   - Tracks correctness percentage
   - Links feedback to specific queries
   - Enables performance trending

2. **Learning Log** (`data/memory/learning_log.json`)
   - Permanent record of all corrections
   - Used for future model fine-tuning
   - Timestamped for analysis

3. **Context Stack** (session memory)
   - Available for immediate retry
   - Influences follow-up responses
   - Helps Genesis understand patterns

### Retry with Improvements

```
Genesis> What is 15% of 200?
Genesis: 30

Genesis> #incorrect — forgot to show the calculation steps

✗ Last response marked as incorrect
📝 Note: forgot to show the calculation steps
Feedback and note stored for future learning.

💡 Tip: Type 'try again' to retry with corrections

Genesis> try again
♻️ Retrying last query: "What is 15% of 200?"

[Thinking... 🧬 Local]

Step 1: Convert percentage to decimal
  → 15% = 15/100 = 0.15

Step 2: Multiply by the number
  → 200 × 0.15 = 30

Final Answer: 30
```

---

## 🔄 Intelligent Retry & Context

### Retry Patterns (5 recognized)

```bash
"try again"       # Most common
"recalculate"     # For math problems
"retry"           # General retry
"redo that"       # Informal
"do that again"   # Natural language
```

### Follow-Up Patterns (5 recognized)

```bash
"explain further"    # More details on topic
"give an example"    # Concrete examples
"tell me more"       # Continue explanation
"elaborate"          # Expand on point
"more details"       # Additional information
```

### Context Stack

- Stores last **15 interactions**
- Automatically detects follow-ups
- Visual indicator: `📚 Using context from previous interaction`
- Auto-prunes when limit reached

### Example: Natural Conversation Flow

```
Genesis> How does quicksort work?
[... explains quicksort ...]

Genesis> give an example
📚 Using context from previous interaction
[... provides code example with array ...]

Genesis> explain the partition step further
📚 Using context from previous interaction
[... detailed partition explanation ...]

Genesis> try again
♻️ Retrying last query: "explain the partition step further"
[... re-explains with different approach ...]
```

```

---

## 🛠️ Code Execution

Genesis can write and execute Python code safely:

### Example: Fibonacci Sequence

```
Genesis> Write a Python script to calculate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers

[Thinking... 🧬 Local]

Pseudocode:
  initialize first two numbers (0, 1)
  for i from 2 to 10:
    next = previous + current
    add next to sequence
  print sequence

Code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]

    fib_sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])

    return fib_sequence

# Calculate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
result = fibonacci(10)
print(f"First 10 Fibonacci numbers: {result}")
```

🔄 Executing code...

Output:
First 10 Fibonacci numbers: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

### Code Execution Safety

- ✅ **Sandboxed**: Runs in isolated `runtime/` directory
- ✅ **Timeout**: 30-second limit prevents infinite loops
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Captures exceptions without crashing
- ✅ **Output Capture**: Shows stdout and stderr separately
- ✅ **Process Isolation**: Each execution in subprocess

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "llama.cpp not found"

**Cause**: llama.cpp not built or path broken

**Solution**:
```bash
cd ~/Genesis/llama.cpp
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

#### "Model not found"

**Check path**:
```bash
ls -lh ~/Genesis/models/CodeLlama-7B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

**Relink model**:
```bash
ln -sf ~/storage/downloads/LLM_Models/CodeLlama-7B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf \
       ~/Genesis/models/CodeLlama-7B-Instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf
```

#### "Python module not found"

**Reinstall dependencies**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade colorama prompt_toolkit
```

#### Slow Responses / Thermal Throttling

**Quick fixes**:
1. Reduce threads: Change `-t 4` to `-t 2` in genesis.py
2. Reduce context: Change `-c 2048` to `-c 1024`
3. Close other apps and clear background processes
4. Ensure device ventilation (avoid direct sunlight)
5. Use `#assist` to offload heavy queries to Claude

**Long-term solutions**:
- Switch to smaller model (Phi-3-mini)
- Enable auto-throttling based on temperature
- Schedule heavy queries during cooler periods

#### Test Failures

**Run diagnostics**:
```bash
cd ~/Genesis
python tests/test_reasoning_fixes.py
```

**Check debug log**:
```bash
# Last 10 entries
cat debug_log.json | jq '.entries | .[-10:]'

# Errors only
cat debug_log.json | jq '.entries[] | select(.type=="error")'

# Today's entries
cat debug_log.json | jq '.entries[] | select(.timestamp | startswith("2025-11-05"))'
```

## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### 1. Deterministic Math Engine (`math_reasoner.py`)

**Problem**: LLMs are probabilistic and often get math wrong (e.g., "bat and ball" problem)

**Solution**: Parse natural language into algebraic expressions and solve deterministically

**Example Implementation**:
```python
class MathReasoner:
    def solve_difference_problem(self, total, difference, larger_name, smaller_name):
        # Equation: x + (x + difference) = total
        # Solution: 2x = total - difference
        smaller_item = (total - difference) / 2
        larger_item = smaller_item + difference

        # Verification
        assert abs(smaller_item + larger_item - total) < 0.01
        assert abs(larger_item - smaller_item - difference) < 0.01

        return {
            "smaller_item": smaller_item,
            "larger_item": larger_item,
            "verified": True
        }
```

**Accuracy**: 100% for supported problem types (vs ~60% for pure LLM)

### 2. Context-Aware Template System

**Problem**: Same reasoning approach for all questions (inefficient)

**Solution**: Detect question type and apply specialized reasoning template

**Templates**:
```python
reasoning_templates = {
    "math_word_problem": {
        "steps": [
            "Understand the problem and identify given information",
            "Define variables for unknown quantities",
            "Set up equations based on relationships",
            "Solve equations step-by-step",
            "Verify the answer makes sense"
        ]
    },
    "programming": {
        "steps": [
            "Understand requirements and constraints",
            "Design algorithm in pseudocode",
            "Implement in target language",
            "Test with example inputs"
        ]
    },
    "metacognitive": {  # NEW - for feedback/limitations
        "steps": [
            "Understand the meta-question or feedback",
            "Identify relevant system capabilities or issues",
            "Explain reasoning or limitation",
            "Provide actionable information"
        ]
    }
}
```

### 3. Priority-Based Answer Selection

**Problem**: Multiple answer sources (calculated, Perplexity, Claude, LLM) - which to trust?

**Solution**: Prioritize by reliability

```python
# 1. Calculated answer (100% accurate for math)
calculated_answer = self.reasoning.get_calculated_answer()
if calculated_answer:
    return calculated_answer

# 2. Perplexity research (current events, facts)
if perplexity_response:
    return perplexity_response

# 3. Claude fallback (complex reasoning)
if claude_response:
    return claude_response

# 4. Local LLM (general queries)
return local_llm_response
```

### 4. Feedback Notes System

**Problem**: Binary #correct/#incorrect doesn't capture nuance

**Solution**: Accept detailed notes with feedback

```python
# Parse: "#incorrect — wrong calculation in step 3"
parts = user_input.split("—", 1)
feedback_type = parts[0].strip().lower()  # "#incorrect"
note = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else None  # "wrong calculation in step 3"

# Store in 3 locations for redundancy & accessibility
self.performance.record_feedback(is_correct, note)
self.learning.add_feedback_note(query, note, is_correct)
self.context_stack[-1]['feedback_note'] = note
```

**Benefits**:
- Fine-grained error analysis
- Training data for fine-tuning
- Immediate retry with corrections

### 5. Thread-Safe Persistence

**Problem**: Concurrent reads/writes can corrupt JSON files

**Solution**: Lock-based synchronization

```python
from threading import Lock

class PerformanceMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._lock = Lock()

    def _save_metrics(self):
        with self._lock:
            with open(self.metrics_file, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(self.metrics, f, indent=2)
```
