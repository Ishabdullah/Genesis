# Android Build Fixes Log

This file tracks all attempted fixes for the Genesis Android APK build issues.

## Problem: libffi autoconf error
**Error Message:** `configure.ac:215: error: possibly undefined macro: LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE`

### Attempt 1: NDK r21e
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK r21e, p4a develop branch
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - NDK too old, p4a requires minimum NDK 25
- **Error:** "The minimum supported NDK version is 25"

### Attempt 2: NDK 25c
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 25c, p4a master branch
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - libffi autoconf error (LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined)
- **Error:** Same autoconf macro error

### Attempt 3: NDK 28c (recommended by p4a)
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 28c, p4a master branch
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - libffi autoconf error (LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined)
- **Error:** Same autoconf macro error
- **Note:** This is the officially recommended NDK version by p4a

### Attempt 4: Added autoconf-archive package
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 28c, p4a master branch, autoconf-archive installed
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - libffi autoconf error (LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined)
- **Error:** Same error - macros not found by aclocal during p4a build
- **Reason:** autoconf-archive installed on runner but not accessible in p4a build environment

### Attempt 5: Export ACLOCAL_PATH environment variables
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 28c, p4a master branch, autoconf-archive + ACLOCAL_PATH export
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - libffi autoconf error (LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined)
- **Changes:**
  - Added `export ACLOCAL_PATH="/usr/share/aclocal:${ACLOCAL_PATH}"`
  - Added `export ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /usr/share/aclocal"`
- **Reason:** Environment variables were set correctly but macros still not found by autogen.sh
- **Note:** ACLOCAL_PATH was confirmed in environment but didn't help

### Attempt 6: Use p4a develop branch with NDK 28c
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 28c, p4a develop branch, autoconf-archive + ACLOCAL_PATH export
- **Result:** ❌ FAILED - libffi autoconf error (LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE undefined)
- **Reason:** develop branch uses Python 3.14 but has same libffi version with same autoconf issues
- **Note:** develop branch is too bleeding edge, same libffi problem persists

### Attempt 7: Remove pyjnius dependency
- **Date:** 2025-11-07
- **Config:** NDK 28c, p4a master branch, requirements WITHOUT pyjnius
- **Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Changes:** Removed pyjnius from requirements (keeps python3, kivy, android, plyer)
- **Trade-off:** Loses Java bridge functionality, but plyer should still provide basic Android APIs
- **Hypothesis:** Python3 still needs libffi for ctypes, but may use system libffi instead of building it

## Build Configuration Summary

### Current Settings:
```
Android API: 33
Android NDK: 28c
Python-for-Android: master branch
Requirements: python3, kivy, pyjnius, android, plyer
Architectures: arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a
```

### Simplified Requirements:
Original requirements included: pillow, requests, certifi, urllib3
These were removed to avoid additional libffi dependencies.

## Next Steps to Try (if current attempt fails):

1. **Try NDK 26b** - Middle ground between 25c and 28c
2. **Use p4a develop branch with NDK 28c** - Latest p4a code may have libffi fixes
3. **Patch libffi recipe** - Create custom p4a recipe to skip problematic macro
4. **Use pre-compiled libffi** - If p4a supports it
5. **Fork p4a and fix libffi** - Last resort, patch the libffi recipe directly

## Root Cause Analysis:

The `LT_SYS_SYMBOL_USCORE` macro is an obsolete libtool macro that was removed in newer autoconf versions. The libffi version used by p4a still references this macro in its configure.ac file, causing autoreconf to fail when building with modern NDK toolchains.

The macro is provided by the autoconf-archive package, but it needs to be in aclocal's search path when libffi's autogen.sh runs during the p4a build process.
