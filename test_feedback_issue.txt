Test scenario to reproduce the #correct and #incorrect issue:

1. Start Genesis: ./genesis.py
2. Ask a simple question: "What is 2 + 2?"
3. Wait for Genesis response
4. Type: #correct
5. Observe behavior

Expected: Genesis should display "✓ Last response marked as correct" and return to prompt
Actual (reported by user): Genesis treats "#correct" as a question

Potential causes:
- The commands might not be recognized due to character encoding
- There might be whitespace issues
- The commands might be processed but also fall through to LLM
- Something else might be intercepting these commands first
